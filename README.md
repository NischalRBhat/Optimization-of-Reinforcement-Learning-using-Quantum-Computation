# ⚛ Optimization of Reinforcement Learning with Quantum Computation ⚛

## 📖 Project Overview

This project focuses on optimizing classical Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques using Quantum Computation. We leverage RL algorithms with quantum circuits, such as Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs), to enhance learning in RL environments. The primary goal is to investigate how Quantum Computing can help achieve space optimization in terms of parameters and potentially allow better performance compared to classical approaches.

This repository is developed as part of our research work and is associated with the research paper:

## 🌎 Environments

### ❄ Frozen Lake Environment

This environment involves navigating across a frozen lake without falling into holes, optimizing the policy to avoid dangers.

### 🛤 Cartpole Environment

Cartpole is a classic environment where the goal is to balance a pole on a moving cart, perfect for testing control and RL algorithms.

### 🚀 Lunar Lander Environment
